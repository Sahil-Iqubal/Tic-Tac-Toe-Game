# Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play the game in the browser by taking turns and checking for a win condition or a draw.

Two-player gameplay: Player "X" and Player "O" take turns to mark the board.
Win detection: Checks for winning combinations across rows, columns, and diagonals.
Draw detection: Declares a draw when no winning combinations are available, and the board is full.
Game reset: The board can be reset to play again after a win or draw.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: For creating the basic structure of the game.
CSS3: To style the game board and elements.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and resetting the game.
